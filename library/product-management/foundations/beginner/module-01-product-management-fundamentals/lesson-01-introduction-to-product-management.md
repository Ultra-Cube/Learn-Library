## Product Strategy Frameworks

### Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD)

#### Framework Overview

**Core Principle**: Customers "hire" products to do specific jobs

**Job Definition Components:**
- Functional job: What task is the customer trying to accomplish?
- Emotional job: How does the customer want to feel?
- Social job: How does the customer want to be perceived?

**Application Process:**
1. Identify the job the customer is trying to do
2. Understand the current solution and its limitations
3. Define the desired outcome and success criteria
4. Design a better solution for the job

#### Practical Example

**Traditional View**: "Customers buy drill bits"
**JTBD View**: "Customers hire drill bits to create holes"
**Insight**: The job is creating holes, not buying drill bits
**Innovation Opportunity**: Alternative hole-creation methods

### OKRs (Objectives and Key Results)

#### Framework Structure

**Objectives**: Qualitative, aspirational goals
- Inspiring and memorable
- Time-bound (usually quarterly)
- Aligned with company strategy

**Key Results**: Quantitative measures of progress
- Specific and measurable
- Ambitious but achievable
- Limited to 3-5 per objective

#### Product Management Application

**Example Product OKR:**

**Objective**: "Dramatically improve user onboarding experience"

**Key Results:**
- Increase 7-day user retention from 45% to 65%
- Reduce time-to-first-value from 30 minutes to 10 minutes
- Achieve 90% onboarding completion rate

### ICE Scoring (Impact, Confidence, Ease)

#### Scoring Framework

**Impact**: How much will this feature affect the key metric?
- Scale: 1-10 (10 = massive impact)
- Consider: Revenue, user satisfaction, strategic value

**Confidence**: How confident are you in the impact estimate?
- Scale: 1-10 (10 = very confident)
- Consider: Data quality, past experience, validation

**Ease**: How easy will this be to implement?
- Scale: 1-10 (10 = very easy)
- Consider: Engineering effort, dependencies, complexity

**ICE Score Calculation**: (Impact × Confidence × Ease) ÷ 100

#### Prioritization Application

**Feature A**: Impact=8, Confidence=9, Ease=3 → ICE=2.16
**Feature B**: Impact=6, Confidence=8, Ease=9 → ICE=4.32
**Priority**: Feature B should be developed first

## User Research Methods

### Qualitative Research

#### Customer Interviews

**Purpose**: Deep understanding of user needs and motivations

**Best Practices:**
- Prepare open-ended questions
- Listen more than you talk
- Ask "why" to understand motivations
- Avoid leading questions
- Record and transcribe sessions

**Sample Questions:**
- "Tell me about the last time you experienced [problem]"
- "What frustrates you most about current solutions?"
- "How do you currently solve this problem?"
- "What would an ideal solution look like?"

#### User Testing

**Purpose**: Observe how users interact with products

**Types:**
- Moderated vs. unmoderated testing
- Remote vs. in-person testing
- Think-aloud protocols
- Task-based testing

**Key Metrics:**
- Task completion rate
- Time to completion
- Error rate and error recovery
- User satisfaction scores

#### Focus Groups

**Purpose**: Group discussion to explore attitudes and perceptions

**Best Practices:**
- 6-8 participants with similar characteristics
- Neutral moderator to guide discussion
- Prepare discussion guide with key topics
- Encourage diverse perspectives and debate

**Limitations:**
- Groupthink and social desirability bias
- Dominant personalities can skew results
- Not suitable for testing specific features
- Qualitative insights, not quantitative validation

### Quantitative Research

#### Surveys

**Purpose**: Collect structured feedback from large user groups

**Survey Types:**
- Customer satisfaction (CSAT) surveys
- Net Promoter Score (NPS) surveys
- Feature request and prioritization surveys
- Market research and segmentation surveys

**Best Practices:**
- Keep surveys short and focused
- Use a mix of question types
- Avoid leading or biased questions
- Test survey with small group first
- Provide incentives for completion

#### Analytics and Metrics

**Behavioral Analytics:**
- User flow and conversion funnels
- Feature usage and engagement metrics
- Retention and churn analysis
- A/B testing and experimentation

**Business Metrics:**
- Revenue and growth metrics
- Customer acquisition cost (CAC)
- Customer lifetime value (CLV)
- Monthly recurring revenue (MRR)

#### A/B Testing

**Purpose**: Compare different versions to determine which performs better

**Test Components:**
- Hypothesis: What you expect will happen
- Variables: What you're testing (one at a time)
- Metrics: How you'll measure success
- Sample size: Statistically significant user groups

**Example A/B Test:**
- **Hypothesis**: Changing button color from blue to green will increase click-through rate
- **Variable**: Button color
- **Metric**: Click-through rate
- **Sample**: 1000 users per variation
