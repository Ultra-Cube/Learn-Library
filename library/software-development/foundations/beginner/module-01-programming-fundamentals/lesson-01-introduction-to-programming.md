## Overview

Learn what programming is, how computers execute instructions, and the fundamental concepts that form the foundation of all software development.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand what programming is and why it's important
- Learn about different programming languages and their uses
- Understand how computers process instructions
- Practice basic problem-solving with algorithms
- Write your first simple program

## What is Programming?

Programming is the process of creating instructions for computers to follow. These instructions, called **code**, tell the computer exactly what to do step by step.

### Key Concepts

**Algorithm**: A step-by-step procedure for solving a problem
- Like a recipe for cooking
- Must be precise and unambiguous
- Can be written in plain language first

**Program**: An algorithm written in a programming language
- Uses specific syntax and rules
- Can be executed by a computer
- Produces predictable results

**Programming Language**: A formal language for writing instructions
- Each has its own syntax and rules
- Examples: Python, JavaScript, Java, C++
- Translated into machine code for execution

## Why Learn Programming?

### Problem Solving
Programming teaches systematic problem-solving:
1. **Analyze** the problem
2. **Break down** into smaller steps
3. **Design** a solution
4. **Implement** the solution
5. **Test** and refine

### Career Opportunities
Programming skills open doors to:
- Software Engineer ($70k-200k+)
- Web Developer ($50k-150k)
- Data Scientist ($80k-180k)
- Mobile App Developer ($60k-160k)
- Game Developer ($55k-140k)

### Creative Expression
Programming is a creative medium:
- Build websites and apps
- Create games and animations
- Automate repetitive tasks
- Solve real-world problems

## Types of Programming Languages

### High-Level vs Low-Level

**High-Level Languages** (easier for humans):
- Python: Great for beginners, data science
- JavaScript: Web development, everywhere
- Java: Enterprise applications, Android
- Swift: iOS app development

**Low-Level Languages** (closer to machine code):
- C: System programming, embedded systems
- Assembly: Direct hardware control
- Machine Code: Binary instructions

### Programming Paradigms

**Procedural Programming**
- Step-by-step instructions
- Functions and procedures
- Examples: C, early BASIC

**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- Organizes code into objects
- Encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism
- Examples: Java, C++, Python

**Functional Programming**
- Functions as first-class citizens
- Immutable data, pure functions
- Examples: Haskell, Lisp, JavaScript

## Your First Algorithm

Let's solve a simple problem: **Make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich**

### Step 1: Break Down the Problem
What do we need?
- Bread (2 slices)
- Peanut butter
- Jelly
- Knife
- Plate

### Step 2: Write the Algorithm
```
1. Get two slices of bread
2. Place bread on plate
3. Open peanut butter jar
4. Get knife
5. Put knife in peanut butter
6. Spread peanut butter on first slice
7. Clean knife
8. Open jelly jar
9. Put knife in jelly
10. Spread jelly on second slice
11. Put slices together (peanut butter and jelly touching)
12. Sandwich is complete
```

### Step 3: Test the Algorithm
- Are the steps clear and specific?
- Could someone else follow these instructions?
- What happens if we're missing an ingredient?

## Programming Concepts Preview

### Variables
Storage containers for data:
```python
name = "Alice"
age = 25
height = 5.6
```

### Data Types
Different kinds of information:
- **String**: Text ("Hello World")
- **Integer**: Whole numbers (42, -17)
- **Float**: Decimal numbers (3.14, -2.5)
- **Boolean**: True or False

### Control Structures
Controlling program flow:
- **If statements**: Make decisions
- **Loops**: Repeat actions
- **Functions**: Reusable code blocks

## Practical Exercise

### Exercise: Daily Routine Algorithm

Write a step-by-step algorithm for your morning routine from waking up to leaving the house.

**Requirements**:
1. Be specific and detailed
2. Include decision points (if/then)
3. Consider different scenarios
4. Think about the order of operations

**Example Start**:
```
1. Alarm goes off
2. If snooze button pressed, wait 9 minutes and go to step 1
3. Otherwise, get out of bed
4. Check the weather
5. If raining, get umbrella
6. ...continue with your routine
```

## Challenge

Create an algorithm for one of these problems:

1. **Making Coffee**: From coffee beans to finished cup
2. **Getting to School/Work**: Including transportation decisions
3. **Doing Laundry**: From dirty clothes to clean and folded
4. **Planning a Birthday Party**: From guest list to celebration

**Advanced Challenge**: Try to identify places where your algorithm might fail or need error handling.

## Solution

A comprehensive morning routine algorithm should include:

### Decision Making
```
1. Wake up (alarm or natural)
2. Check time
3. If too early, go back to sleep
4. If on time, proceed to step 5
5. Check weather
6. If sunny, choose light clothes
7. If rainy, choose jacket and umbrella
8. If cold, choose warm clothes
```

### Sequential Steps
```
9. Brush teeth
10. Wash face
11. Get dressed
12. Make breakfast
13. Eat breakfast
14. Check schedule for the day
15. Gather needed items (keys, wallet, phone)
16. Lock door
17. Leave house
```

### Error Handling
- What if alarm doesn't go off?
- What if weather changes?
- What if running late?

## The Development Process
