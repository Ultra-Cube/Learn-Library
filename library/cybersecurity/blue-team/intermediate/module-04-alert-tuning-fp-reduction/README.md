# Cybersecurity / Blue Team / Intermediate — Alert Tuning & False Positive Reduction

Reduce alert noise and improve detection precision with baseline-driven tuning, exceptions, and feedback loops.

## Lessons

- Lesson 01 — Alert Tuning Fundamentals (noise, precision, exceptions)
- Lesson 02 — Feedback Loops and Rule Lifecycle (metrics, suppressions)

## Outcomes

- Measure and reduce false positives while preserving detection coverage
- Operate a simple detection lifecycle with metrics and reviews
