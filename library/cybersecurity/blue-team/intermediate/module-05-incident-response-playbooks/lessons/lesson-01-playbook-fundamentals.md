## Overview

Learn the structure of effective incident response playbooks: clear steps, defined roles, decision points, and escalation triggers.

## Learning objectives

- Design playbook structure with phases and decision trees
- Define roles and responsibilities across teams
- Add escalation triggers and communication templates

## Key terms

- Playbook — structured response procedure for a specific incident type
- Decision tree — flowchart showing conditional steps based on findings
- Escalation trigger — condition requiring management or external notification

## Explanation

A good playbook includes:

- Trigger conditions (when to use this playbook)
- Immediate containment steps (stop the bleeding)
- Investigation phase (scope, timeline, evidence)
- Recovery actions (restore, monitor, lessons learned)
- Clear roles: Incident Commander, Technical Lead, Communications, Legal

Use decision points like "Is PII involved?" or "Are > 100 hosts affected?" to branch steps and escalation.

## Exercises

1. Draft a playbook outline for suspected malware with 3 decision points.
2. Define 4 roles and their primary responsibilities during an incident.

## Challenges & Activities

- Activity (10m): Create escalation triggers for 3 severity levels (low/medium/high).
- Challenge (25m): Design a decision tree for "Suspicious Network Activity" with 5 branches.
- Stretch: Add communication templates for initial notification and status updates.

## Puzzle

Your malware playbook says "isolate the host" but the affected system runs a critical database. What decision point and alternative steps should the playbook include?
