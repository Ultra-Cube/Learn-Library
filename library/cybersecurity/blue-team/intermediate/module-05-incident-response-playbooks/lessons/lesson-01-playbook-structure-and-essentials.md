## Overview

Learn the anatomy of a response playbook: triggers, steps, roles, documentation, and review.

## Learning objectives

- Identify playbook components: triggers, actions, roles, evidence
- Draft a basic playbook for a common incident
- Document and review playbook execution

## Key terms

- Trigger — event or alert that starts the playbook
- Role — assigned responsibility (analyst, comms, IT, legal)
- Evidence — logs, artifacts, screenshots, notes

## Explanation

- Start with a clear trigger (e.g., alert, user report)
- List stepwise actions: triage, containment, eradication, recovery, postmortem
- Assign roles and responsibilities for each step
- Document actions, evidence, and decisions
- Review playbook after each use and update as needed

## Exercises

1. Draft a playbook outline for a malware infection on a user workstation.
2. List three types of evidence to collect during triage.

## Challenges & Activities

- Activity (10m): Assign roles for each step in your playbook.
- Challenge (20m): Simulate a tabletop exercise and document actions taken.
- Stretch: Add a postmortem review checklist.

## Puzzle

Your playbook missed a key containment step, leading to spread. How do you update the playbook and prevent recurrence?
