## Overview

Practice using playbooks for two high-impact scenarios: ransomware and phishing.

## Learning objectives

- Apply playbook steps to real-world incidents
- Collect and preserve evidence
- Communicate and escalate as needed

## Key terms

- Containment — actions to limit spread/damage
- Escalation — involving higher-level teams or external partners
- Recovery — restoring systems and data

## Explanation

- Ransomware: isolate affected systems, preserve evidence, notify stakeholders, restore from backups, report to authorities
- Phishing: identify affected users, block malicious domains, reset credentials, educate users, document incident
- For both: follow playbook steps, document actions, review and improve playbook after incident

## Exercises

1. List three containment actions for ransomware.
2. Draft a communication template for a phishing incident.

## Challenges & Activities

- Activity (10m): Simulate evidence collection for a ransomware event.
- Challenge (20m): Run a phishing tabletop and document escalation steps.
- Stretch: Propose a recovery checklist for both scenarios.

## Puzzle

A user reports a suspicious email after clicking a link. What immediate steps do you take, and how do you ensure evidence is preserved?
