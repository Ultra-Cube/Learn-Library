## Overview

Learn safe app practices: sources, permissions, and updates.

## Learning objectives

- Install apps from trusted stores
- Review and limit permissions
- Update and remove unused apps

## Key terms

- Sideloading — installing apps from outside official stores
- Least privilege — granting minimal required access
- Permission prompts — runtime requests for access

## Explanation

- Prefer official stores; avoid risky sideloading.
- Periodically audit app list and permissions; revoke unused access.
- Keep apps updated; watch for shady clones and excessive permissions.

## Exercises

1. List three apps with permissions you can safely reduce.
2. Identify one app with excessive permissions and an alternative app.

## Challenges & Activities

- Activity (10m): Review location and microphone permissions and revoke unnecessary access.
- Challenge (10–15m): Audit your installed app list and remove at least three unused apps.
- Stretch: Enable per-app network/notification controls where supported.
