## Overview

Reduce common mobile risks with strong device locks, timely updates, and reliable backups.

## Learning objectives

- Enable automatic OS and app updates
- Configure strong screen lock and device encryption
- Set up secure backups and device tracking

## Key terms

- Biometric — fingerprint/face unlock
- Device encryption — protects data at rest
- Remote wipe — erase device remotely if lost

## Explanation

- Turn on auto-updates for OS and apps; avoid outdated devices.
- Use strong PIN/long passcode; enable biometrics as convenience.
- Enable device encryption and cloud backups; configure Find My/Find My Device.

## Exercises

1. Document where to enable OS/app auto-updates on your device.
2. Verify encryption status and backup settings.

## Challenges & Activities

- Activity (10m): Change to a longer passcode and re-enroll biometrics.
- Challenge (10–15m): Test a backup restore of a small set of data (e.g., notes/photos).
- Stretch: Create a “travel profile” with stricter Bluetooth/NFC/Wi-Fi settings.

## Puzzle

You lost your phone with no passcode and outdated OS. What are the risks and what steps should you take now?
