## Overview

Spot influence tactics (urgency, authority, scarcity) and common social engineering patterns.

## Learning objectives

- Recognize psychological levers used in attacks
- Identify red flags across channels
- Apply a pause-and-verify habit

## Key terms

- Pretexting — creating a fabricated scenario to trick targets
- BEC — Business Email Compromise
- Vishing — voice phishing

## Explanation

- Tactics: urgency, authority, fear, curiosity, reciprocity.
- Red flags: mismatched domains, unusual payment changes, unexpected attachments, secrecy requests.
- Habit: pause, verify with a known channel, report.

## Exercises

1. Highlight three red flags from a sample message you encountered recently.
2. Map each red flag to the underlying tactic.

## Challenges & Activities

- Activity (10m): Build a personal “pause-and-verify” checklist.
- Challenge (10–15m): Draft a safe response template for suspicious requests at work.
- Stretch: Collect two BEC examples (sanitized) and annotate indicators.

## Puzzle

A vendor emails to change bank details urgently before a deadline. What flags should you check and how do you verify?
