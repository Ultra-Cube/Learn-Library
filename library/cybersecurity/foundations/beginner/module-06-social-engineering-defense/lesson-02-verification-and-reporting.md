## Overview

Use a consistent process to verify requests and report incidents.

## Learning objectives

- Verify identity through known channels
- Escalate and report suspicious activity
- Document steps taken

## Key terms

- Out-of-band — a separate, trusted channel
- Escalation — notifying responsible teams/persons
- Evidence — records/screenshots collected appropriately

## Explanation

- Verification: use known phone numbers, vendor portals; avoid replying to the same email.
- Reporting: use org ticketing/report tools; include minimal necessary details.
- Documentation: time, what was requested, how you verified, outcomes.

## Exercises

1. Write a step-by-step verification process for payment changes.
2. Draft a minimal incident report template for your context.

## Challenges & Activities

- Activity (10m): Create an out-of-band contact list for key vendors.
- Challenge (10–15m): Simulate a verification call script for a sensitive change.
- Stretch: Define when to escalate to security/legal/compliance.

## Puzzle

You verified a request using a number from the email footer and it was fraudulent. What went wrong and how should you verify next time?
