## Overview

Understand why timely updates and reliable backups are essential for resilience.

## Learning objectives

- Configure auto-updates on OS, apps, and browsers
- Design a simple 3-2-1 backup strategy
- Test restore to verify backups

## Key terms

- Patch — a fix for a software vulnerability
- 3-2-1 Backup — 3 copies, 2 media types, 1 off-site
- RPO/RTO — recovery point/time objectives

## Explanation

- Enable automatic updates and schedule reboots.
- Use 3-2-1: primary data + 2 backups (local + cloud/offsite).
- Periodically test restores to ensure backups work.

## Exercises

1. On your OS, list where to enable automatic updates and how to verify.
2. Draft a 3-2-1 backup plan for your personal files.

## Challenges & Activities

- Activity (10m): Update a browser and extensions; verify version and changelog.
- Challenge (10–15m): Perform a small file backup + restore test and record findings.
- Stretch: Compare two backup tools and justify one for non-technical users.

## Puzzle

Your backup drive was always plugged in during a ransomware event. What went wrong, and how would you redesign?
