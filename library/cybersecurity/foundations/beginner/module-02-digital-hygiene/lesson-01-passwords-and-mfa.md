## Overview

Learn how to create strong passwords, manage them safely, and enable MFA for better protection.

## Learning objectives

- Create strong, unique passwords
- Understand password managers
- Enable MFA across common services

## Key terms

- Password Manager — a tool that securely stores and generates passwords
- MFA — multi-factor authentication; requires something you know/have/are
- OTP — one-time password (TOTP/SMS)

## Explanation

- Use a password manager to generate and store unique passwords per site.
- Prefer passphrases ≥ 16 characters with randomness.
- Enable MFA wherever possible; prefer authenticator apps or security keys over SMS.

## Exercises

1. Turn one weak password into a strong passphrase and explain your choices.
2. List three popular password managers and one pro/one con for each.

## Challenges & Activities

- Activity (10m): Generate three site-specific passwords using a manager and store recovery codes securely.
- Challenge (10–15m): Enable MFA on one email and one social account; document the backup methods used.
- Stretch: Research FIDO2 security keys and summarize how they resist phishing.

## Puzzle

A site only supports SMS-based MFA. What are two residual risks, and how can you mitigate them?
