#### **Password Cracking Time Analysis**

**Time to Crack Passwords by Method** (2024 Hardware):

| Password Type | Length | Brute Force | Dictionary | GPU Cluster |
|---------------|--------|-------------|------------|-------------|
| **Simple (password123)** | 11 chars | < 1 second | < 1 second | < 1 second |
| **Complex (P@ssw0rd!)** | 9 chars | 2 hours | 3 minutes | < 1 second |
| **Passphrase (correct-horse-battery)** | 20 chars | 6 million years | 2 days | 4 hours |
| **Random (Kx9#mP2$vQ8&)** | 12 chars | 62 years | N/A | 2 weeks |
| **Generated (aV$8nM3#zR9@pL5%)** | 16 chars | 34,000 years | N/A | 15 years |

### Modern Password Standards

#### **NIST SP 800-63B Guidelines** (Updated 2024)

**Requirements**:
- **Minimum 8 characters** for user-chosen passwords
- **Minimum 6 characters** for system-generated passwords
- **No composition rules** (complexity requirements counterproductive)
- **No periodic password changes** unless compromise suspected
- **Screen against common passwords** and breached credentials

**Recommendations**:

```mermaid
