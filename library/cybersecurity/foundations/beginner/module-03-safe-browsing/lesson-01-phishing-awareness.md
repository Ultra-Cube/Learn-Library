**Objective**: Develop expert-level email analysis skills using real-world examples

**Duration**: 20 minutes

**Phishing Email Analysis Exercise**:

**Sample Email Headers to Analyze**:
```
From: security@paypaI.com (Note: 'I' instead of 'l')
To: user@company.com
Subject: Urgent: Verify Your Account Now
Return-Path: <notifications@suspicious-domain.ru>
DKIM-Signature: v=1; a=rsa-sha256; d=fake-domain.com...
Received-SPF: fail (paypal.com: 192.168.1.100 not permitted)
```

**Analysis Tasks**:
1. **Visual Inspection**: Identify domain spoofing attempts
2. **Technical Verification**: Check SPF, DKIM, DMARC results
3. **Content Analysis**: Evaluate language, urgency, and requests
4. **Link Investigation**: Analyze URLs without clicking
5. **Risk Assessment**: Rate threat level and recommend actions

**Expected Findings Documentation**:

```
Email Security Assessment Report:
Sender Authenticity:     FAIL - Domain spoofing detected
Technical Verification:  FAIL - SPF/DKIM/DMARC failures
Content Analysis:        HIGH RISK - Urgency + credential request
Link Safety:            MALICIOUS - Redirects to fake site
Overall Risk Level:      CRITICAL - Do not interact

Recommended Actions:
1. Delete email immediately
2. Report to security team
3. Block sender domain
4. Alert other users
5. Monitor for similar attacks
```

### **Lab 2: Business Email Compromise Simulation**

**Objective**: Recognize and respond to sophisticated BEC attacks

**Scenario Setup**: You're a finance manager who receives an "urgent" email from the CEO

**Simulated BEC Email**:
```
From: ceo@company.com (verified domain)
To: finance-manager@company.com
Subject: Re: Confidential Acquisition Payment

Hi [Your Name],

Hope you're well. I need your assistance with a time-sensitive 
confidential matter. We're finalizing the acquisition of TechStart 
Inc. and need to transfer $850,000 to their account today to close 
the deal before the weekend.

This needs to stay confidential until we announce next week. 
Please process the wire transfer to:

Bank: First National Trust
Account: 123456789
Routing: 987654321
Beneficiary: TechStart Holdings LLC

Please confirm when complete. I'm in back-to-back meetings but 
you can text me at 555-0199 if urgent.

Thanks for your discretion on this.

Best,
[CEO Name]
```

**Red Flag Analysis Exercise**:

**Identify the BEC Warning Signs**:
1. What social engineering techniques are being used?
2. What verification steps should be taken before any action?
3. How would you safely verify this request?
4. What policies should prevent this type of fraud?

**Proper Response Procedure**:
```
BEC Response Checklist:
‚òëÔ∏è STOP - Do not process payment immediately
‚òëÔ∏è VERIFY - Contact CEO through known phone number
‚òëÔ∏è VALIDATE - Check with legal/compliance team
‚òëÔ∏è DOCUMENT - Save email for security investigation
‚òëÔ∏è REPORT - Notify security team of potential BEC
‚òëÔ∏è EDUCATE - Share with finance team as training
