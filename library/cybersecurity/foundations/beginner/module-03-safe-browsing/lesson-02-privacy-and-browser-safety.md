## Overview

Reduce tracking, improve privacy, and harden your browser settings.

## Learning objectives

- Configure basic privacy protections
- Use password manager + HTTPS-only mode
- Evaluate privacy extensions carefully

## Key terms

- Tracking — collection of browsing data
- HTTPS — encrypted HTTP
- Content blocking — preventing ads/trackers from loading

## Explanation

- Turn on HTTPS-only mode; disable third-party cookies; limit permissions (mic, cam, location).
- Consider reputable privacy extensions; avoid overlapping/duplicative ones.
- Use separate profiles/containers for isolation when needed.

## Exercises

1. Enable HTTPS-only and describe how to verify it’s working.
2. List three privacy extensions and one risk for each.

## Challenges & Activities

- Activity (10m): Review your browser permissions and revoke anything unnecessary.
- Challenge (10–15m): Create a “travel profile” with stricter settings and test common sites.
- Stretch: Compare two browsers’ privacy defaults and summarize differences.

## Puzzle

Your bank requires cross-site cookies for the login widget to work. How do you enable it safely without globally weakening privacy?
