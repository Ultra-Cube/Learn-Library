## Overview

Install VS Code, learn Git basics, and connect your editor to GitHub to contribute to this library.

## Learning objectives

- Install VS Code and essential extensions
- Use Git (clone, branch, commit, push)
- Open pull requests (PRs) and link work to issues

## Key terms

- Repository — a project tracked by Git
- Branch — a separate line of development
- Pull Request — a proposed change to merge into a repository

## Explanation

- Install VS Code and sign in for settings sync (optional).
- Extensions: Markdown All in One, YAML, GitHub Pull Requests, GitLens.
- Git basics: configure name/email; clone repo; create branch per feature; commit small, atomic changes; push and open PRs.

## Exercises

1. Install VS Code and extensions; take a screenshot or list versions.
2. Clone this Learn-Library repo locally and open it in VS Code.

## Challenges & Activities

- Activity (10m): Create a new branch (e.g., `content/add-cyb-beg-lesson`) and edit a lesson using the template.
- Challenge (15–20m): Commit with a descriptive message, push your branch, and open a PR linking to an issue.
- Stretch: Resolve a PR comment by amending a commit and pushing again.

## Puzzle

Your PR fails checks because the lesson metadata is incomplete. Where do you look and how do you fix it?
