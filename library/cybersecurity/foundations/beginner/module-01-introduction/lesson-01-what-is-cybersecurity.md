## Overview

Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and data from digital attacks, damage, or unauthorized access.

## Learning objectives

- Understand the core goals of cybersecurity (CIA triad)
- Recognize basic threat types and actors
- Identify everyday security practices

## Key terms

- Confidentiality — limiting access to authorized parties only
- Integrity — ensuring information is accurate and unaltered
- Availability — ensuring systems and data are accessible when needed
- Threat — a potential cause of an unwanted incident
- Vulnerability — a weakness that can be exploited
- Risk — the potential for loss or damage when a threat exploits a vulnerability

## Explanation

Cybersecurity spans people, processes, and technology. At its core, it aims to preserve the CIA triad:

- Confidentiality: encryption, access controls, data classification
- Integrity: hashing, digital signatures, change monitoring
- Availability: redundancy, backups, incident response

Common threat actors include cybercriminals, insiders, hacktivists, and nation-states. Basic safeguards like strong passwords, MFA, software updates, and phishing awareness dramatically reduce risk.

## Exercises

1. List three examples of controls that support each part of the CIA triad.
2. Identify two daily habits that improve personal security.

## Puzzle

You receive an email asking you to reset your bank password urgently using a link. The sender address is misspelled and the link domain is unfamiliar. What signs indicate phishing, and what should you do?
