## 🛡️ The CIA Triad: Foundation of Information Security

The **CIA Triad** forms the cornerstone of information security principles:

### 🔒 **Confidentiality**

**Definition**: Ensuring information is accessible only to authorized individuals.

**Real-world Examples**:
- Bank account details protected by login credentials
- Medical records restricted to healthcare providers
- Corporate secrets protected by NDAs and access controls

**Threats**: Data breaches, eavesdropping, social engineering
**Controls**: Encryption, access controls, authentication

### 🔍 **Integrity**

**Definition**: Maintaining accuracy and completeness of data throughout its lifecycle.

**Real-world Examples**:
- Financial transaction records that cannot be altered
- Software updates verified with digital signatures
- Medical prescriptions that remain unchanged from doctor to pharmacy

**Threats**: Malware, unauthorized modifications, system errors
**Controls**: Digital signatures, checksums, version control

### ⚡ **Availability**

**Definition**: Ensuring authorized users have access to information when needed.

**Real-world Examples**:
- Online banking systems operational 24/7
- Emergency services communication systems
- E-commerce websites during peak shopping periods

**Threats**: DDoS attacks, hardware failures, natural disasters
**Controls**: Redundancy, backups, disaster recovery plans

### 📈 **CIA Triad in Action**

## ✅ Progress Check

### **Knowledge Verification Questions**

1. **Explain the CIA Triad**: Describe each component and provide a real-world example for each.

2. **Threat Actor Analysis**: Match each threat actor type with their primary motivation:
   - Nation-State Actors → [Economic espionage / Political protest / Financial gain]
