# Solutions — Secure Wi‑Fi and Router Settings

## Exercises

1. Router UI locations vary; typically under Administration/Management and Wireless/Security.
2. WPA2‑AES or WPA3 with a long passphrase (16+); avoid WEP/WPA‑TKIP.

## Puzzle

Casting often needs local network discovery blocked by guest isolation. Safe workaround: a separate “home” SSID for trusted devices, keep IoT on guest.
