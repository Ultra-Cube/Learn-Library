## Overview

Harden your home router and Wi‑Fi to reduce common risks.

## Learning objectives

- Choose modern Wi‑Fi security (WPA3/WPA2)
- Change default admin credentials
- Apply basic segmentation for IoT

## Key terms

- WPA2/WPA3 — Wi‑Fi security standards
- SSID — Wi‑Fi network name
- Guest Network — isolated network for visitors/devices

## Explanation

- Update router firmware; disable WPS and UPnP if not needed.
- Set strong admin password; use WPA3 or WPA2‑AES with a long passphrase.
- Use a guest or IoT network for untrusted devices; consider DNS filtering.

## Exercises

1. Find your router admin UI and record where to update firmware and change admin credentials.
2. List your current Wi‑Fi security mode and passphrase length.

## Challenges & Activities

- Activity (10m): Create a guest network and connect an IoT device to it; confirm isolation.
- Challenge (15–20m): Change DNS to a reputable resolver with filtering and test.
- Stretch: Map devices by MAC and vendor; label critical ones.

## Puzzle

Your smart TV can’t cast from your phone after moving it to the guest network. What’s the likely cause, and what’s a safe workaround?
