- Microservices, serverless, containers

**Repurchase** ("Drop and Shop")
- Move to SaaS solution
- Replace custom applications
- Reduces maintenance burden

**Retain** ("Revisit")
- Keep applications on-premises
- Not ready for cloud migration
- Legacy or compliance constraints

**Retire** ("Remove")
