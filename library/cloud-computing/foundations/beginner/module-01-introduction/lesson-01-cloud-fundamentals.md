## ☁️ What is Cloud Computing?

### NIST Official Definition

According to the **National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST SP 800-145)**:

> "Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction."

### Five Essential Characteristics

Software licenses (Exchange):       $28,000
IT staff allocation (30%):          $36,000
Power and cooling:                  $8,000
Maintenance and support:            $12,000
Total Annual Cost:                  $129,000
```

**Microsoft 365 Cloud Costs** (Annual):
```
Business Premium licenses (200 users): $60,000
Migration consulting:                   $15,000
Training:                              $5,000
Total Annual Cost:                     $80,000 (Year 1)
                                       $60,000 (Years 2+)
```

**ROI Calculation**:
- **Year 1 Savings**: $129,000 - $80,000 = $49,000
- **Annual Savings** (Years 2+): $129,000 - $60,000 = $69,000
- **3-Year Total Savings**: $49,000 + $69,000 + $69,000 = $187,000
