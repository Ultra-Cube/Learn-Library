## 🎯 **Next Step Completion Status: COMPLETED** ✅

**Structural Issue Resolved**: Successfully moved labs and assessments from root directories to domain-specific organization within the library structure, as identified by the user.

## 🏗️ **Major Structural Improvements Implemented**

### **Before: Poor Organization**
```
Learn-Library/
├── labs/                    # ❌ Root level - not domain organized
│   ├── docker-containers/
│   ├── environments/
