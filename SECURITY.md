    Securely hash a password using bcrypt.
    WARNING: Never store passwords in plain text!
    """
    import bcrypt
    salt = bcrypt.gensalt()
    return bcrypt.hashpw(password.encode('utf-8'), salt)

# ❌ Bad: Insecure example without context
def store_password(password: str) -> str:
    return password  # This is insecure!
```
